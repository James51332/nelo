# nelo

A stateless, timeline-driven animation engine for explorable visual animations.

# philosophy

nelo treats every animation as a pure function of time. No object state, no imperative updates. Just describe what the scene should look like at any time `t`.

* Stateless by design
* Fully scrub-friendly
* Composable: animations donâ€™t interfere
* Ideal for teaching, math, CS, and design
